# BAS - Business Automation Suite

Many organizations and individuals rely on automation across various contexts in their daily operations. With BAS, we aim to provide an open-source platform that empowers users to create customized automation systems tailored to their unique requirements. BAS consists of a series of abstract components designed to facilitate the creation of diverse bots, regardless of context.

The underlying idea is to develop generic components that can serve a wide range of needs, this approach ensures that all members of the community can leverage the platform's evolving suite of components and bots to their advantage.

### BOT
A bot is a tool responsible for executing a specific automation task. The bot's pipeline consists of reading from a shared storage (if required), processing a particular task, and then writing the result to a shared storage.

### Use case
A use case refers to an automation problem larger than what a single bot can manage. It typically involves a set of bots, each solving a specific part of the overall problem independently. To enable these bots to interact, shared storage is used. This shared storage could be a PostgreSQL database, an S3 bucket, or another shared storage type, allowing bots to read and write data that other bots can access to complete their tasks.

## Shared Storage
Shared storage is a central location where data can be read and written by multiple bots to facilitate coordination in an automation task. It serves as a common data exchange point, allowing each bot to access information generated by others as needed to complete its specific task. Examples of shared storage include a PostgreSQL database, an S3 bucket, or other types of storage systems that support concurrent access and data persistence.

### Read and Write data

The `SharedStorage` class abstracts the process of reading from and writing to shared storage. This class specification is available in `bas/shared_storage/base.rb`, from which custom implementations can be built.

Currently, the gem supports: `PostgreSQL`.

### Configurations

This configuration provides an example of the structure a PostgreSQL shared storage would require for this purpose. The exact structure should be tailored to the nature of the implemented use cases.

### Optional Dependencies

BAS supports integrations with various external services like GitHub, Notion, OpenAI, and more. To use these integrations, you need to install the required gems manually.

**Installing Optional Dependencies**

The following gems are needed to use the following optional dependencies, add to your Gemfile or install them individually:

```ruby
- GitHub Integration:   gem 'octokit', '~> 8.1.0'
                        gem 'jwt", "~> 2.8.1'
                        gem 'openssl', '~> 3.2'

- Notion Integration:   gem 'md_to_notion', '~> 0.1.4'

- Google Integration:   gem 'google-api-client', '~> 0.53'
                        gem 'googleauth', '~> 1.11'

- IMAP/SMTP Email:      gem 'net-imap', '~> 0.4.10'
                        gem 'net-smtp', '~> 0.4.0.1'

- Gmail OAuth:          gem 'gmail_xoauth', '~> 0.4.1'
```


```sql
CREATE TABLE api_data(
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    "data" jsonb,
    tag varchar(255),
    archived boolean,
    stage varchar(255),
    status varchar(255),
    error_message jsonb,
    version varchar(255),
    inserted_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```

### Implementation examples

#### Example 1: Using the Same Shared Storage for Reading and Writing

In some cases, a bot may need to both read from and write to the same shared storage. Here is an example implementation using a PostgreSQL database as shared storage:

```ruby
connection = {
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  dbname: "bas",
  user: "postgres",
  password: "postgres"
}

read_options = {
  connection: connection,
  db_table: "api_data",
  tag: "AnotherBot"
}

write_options = {
  connection: connection,
  db_table: "api_data",
  tag: "FetchFromAPi"
}

options = {
  token: "api_token"
}

shared_storage = SharedStorage.new(read_options: read_options, write_options: write_options)

bot = Bas::Bot::FetchFromAPi.new(options, shared_storage)
bot.execute
```

#### Example 2: Using Different Shared Storage Instances for Reading and Writing

In some situations, it may be beneficial to use separate shared storage instances for reading and writing. For example, a bot might read from a default shared storage implementation and write to a PostgreSQL database:

```ruby
connection = {
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  dbname: "bas",
  user: "postgres",
  password: "postgres"
}

write_options = {
  connection: connection,
  db_table: "api_data",
  tag: "FetchFromAPi"
}

options = {
  token: "api_token"
}

shared_storage_reader = Bas::SharedStorage::Default.new
shared_storage_writer = Bas::SharedStorage::Postgres.new(write_options: write_options)

bot = Bas::Bot::FetchFromAPi.new(options, shared_storage_reader, shared_storage_writer)
bot.execute
```

In this example, the shared_storage_reader is a default implementation that does not perform actual reading operations, while shared_storage_writer writes to a PostgreSQL database.

## Building my own BOT

The gem provides essential interfaces, types, and methods to help you easily create your own bot. For instance, two base classes are provided: one for handling shared storage read-write operations and another for defining the bot’s specific task logic.

### Bot - Solve a specific automation task
The bot executes the logic required to complete a specific task. For this, an instance of shared storage (for reading and for writing) must be provided to the bot.

The base interface for a bot is available in the `bas/bot/base.rb class`.

## Examples

### Define the bot

In this example, we demonstrate how to configure a bot to fetch data from an API and save it in a postgres database.

For this, a bot could be defined as follow:
```ruby
require "httparty"

module Bas
  module Bot
    class FetchFromAPi
      URL = 'some-url.com'

      def process
        request = HTTParty.get(URL, { headers: })

        if request.code == 200
          { success: request.body }
        else
          { error: request.error_message }
        end
      end

      private

      def headers
        {
          "Authorization" => "Bearer #{process_options[:token]}",
          "Content-Type" => "application/json"
        }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The `Bot::Base` interface expects the process method to return a hash with a single key, which can be `success` (when the response is valid) or `error` (when an error occurs). This consistency allows SharedStorage to handle the same data types regardless of the specific bot used.

Finally, to execute the bot we could define it like follows:

```ruby
connection = {
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  dbname: "bas",
  user: "postgres",
  password: "postgres"
}

read_options = {
  connection:,
  db_table: "api_data",
  tag: "AnotherBot"
}

write_options = {
  connection:,
  db_table: "api_data",
  tag: "FetchFromAPi"
}

options = {
  token: "api_token"
}

shared_storage = SharedStorage.new(read_options:, write_options:)

bot = Bas::Bot::FetchFromAPi.new(options, shared_storage)
bot.execute
```

The `tag` parameter in the read and write options specifies which record to look at (when reading) and what tag to assign to the record (when writing). This way, each bot can work independently with its own records in the shared storage.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
